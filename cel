今天星期天，马上就要国庆了，足球，作业，上课。忙活，开会。一天天的就是这些事。
   做好的简单的事情调整好，自己每天的心情，情绪太重要了，一定学会独立思考。
   
   又不能编辑了，总是有很多事，一定要学会适应变化，太多的变化，太多的变数，这就是人生。
好，总算有点小收获，每天学点东西，英语，计算机足球相关的东西，不管什么情况，学习很重要，对我来说，我看中技能。
Today, Sunday, I am going to the National Day, football, homework, and class. Busy, meeting. These things are happening every day.
    Do a good job of adjusting things well, your daily mood, emotions are too important, you must learn to think independently.
   
    Can't edit, there are always many things, you must learn to adapt to change, too many changes, too many variables, this is life.
Ok, it’s a little bit of a harvest. I learn something every day, English, computer football related things. No matter what the situation, learning is very important. For me, I am interested in skills.
    加上一点关于python学习的东西，学会使用GitHub。
    考虑孩子的内心，多鼓励，站在的孩子的角度去学习。
